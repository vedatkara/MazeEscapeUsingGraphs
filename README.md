# MazeEscapeUsingGraphs

* A maze can be represented as a graph. This project takes a text-file's path that hava a maze inside from the user and convert the maze into a graph.
* Each space represents a vertex. 
* Program solves the maze using four different ways:
1. Cheapest Path Algorithm
2. Shortest Path Algorithm
3. Breadth-First Search
4. Depth-First Search

* As an output, it prints edges, pathes and adjacency matrix.
